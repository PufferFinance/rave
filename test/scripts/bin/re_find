"""
    Linux-based regex tools all suck compared to the
    simplicity of using Python's re.findall.

    Success: This program returns matches as a
    space delimited list with each match escaped
    and quoted for use as inputs or args.

    Failure: Otherwise it returns nothing.
    Allows programs to easily parse text and
    detect failure cases.
